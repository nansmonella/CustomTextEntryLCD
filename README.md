# CustomTextEntryLCD

This project is done with the usage of analog-to-digital converter(ADC), LCD, timers, and LEDs of a PIC18F8722.

Using the custom text entry program, the user will be able to enter any character he wants at any point in the first line of the LCD. By using the potentiometer, the user will be able to move the cursor to the cell he wants to insert a character. By using the buttons on the board, the user can select a character from the predefined set of characters ([a-z0-9]) or he can insert a custom character he defines using the LEDs. When the user is done with the text entry, the text will scroll on the LCD infinitely.

When the user wants to define a custom character, he will go into the custom character definition (CCD) mode. In this mode, the user will turn on and off LEDs in a 4x8 LED grid on the board. To move around this grid the user will use an invisible cursor which will be controlled by the buttons on the board. Since the cursor is invisible, the coordinates of the cursor will be displayed in the rightmost two digits of the seven-segment display.

Due to constraints of the LCD, user can define at most 8 custom characters. Number of characters defined by the user will be shown in the leftmost digit of the seven-segment display.
